### Feature 1 - Deleting Transaction

1. Created the `removeTransaction` method to handle deletion of a transaction based on its index in the list.
2. Facilitated with the command `delete` followed by the index ID of the transaction to be deleted.
3. Implemented error handling for various edge cases, including empty input, invalid index, and out-of-bound
   index.
4. Removed the transaction from the transaction list and updated the account balance. Then the user will
   get the confirmation message about the process.

**What it does:** Allows users to delete the transaction. <br>
**Justification:** this feature is key to the BudgetBuddy as users need to be able to delete the transactions
which has errors or added by mistake.

### Feature 2 - Editing Transaction

1. Implemented the `processEditTransaction` method to facilitate editing of a transaction based on its index.
2. Facilitated by the command `edit` followed by the index ID of the transaction to be edited.
3. Validated user input for the index and transaction data, handling exceptions such as empty input and
   non-integer index.
4. Prompted the user to provide updated information for the transaction and validated each piece of data,
   and throw appropriate exceptions associated with the input being given.
5. Updated the transaction list with the edited transaction and printed a confirmation message.
   
**What it does:** Allows users to edit the transaction.<br>
**Justification:** this feature is key to the BudgetBuddy as users need to be able to edit the transactions 
which has been added with some mistakes and need to be updated. <br>
**Highlights:** Instead of expecting the user to type long command this feature prompts the user to input 
value for each data

### Feature 3 - Search Transaction

1. Implemented the `searchTransaction` method to facilitate searching of transactions using a keyword 
   based on description, date, category or amount.
2. Facilitated by the command `search` followed by the keyword.
3. If the keyword is missing, exception is thrown and the suer will be alerted
4. The keyword is used to search from the list and the matching results will be shows as a table along 
   with its true **index ID**. If there is no matching transactions, then the user will be notified that there is no matching transactions.

**What it does:** Allows users to search for transactions<br>
**Justification:** this feature is key to the BudgetBuddy as if the transaction is history is too long and 
a user wants to delete or edit transaction. Then this search functionality will be helpful as the user can 
enter a keyword to search for it to get the true index ID of the transaction. Then that ID can be used in 
delete or edit command.
